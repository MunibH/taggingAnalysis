# TODO

a. Write data loading script to handle different probe types and regions
b. go through loading scripts and make sure they work well

1. single cell analysis
    1. selectivity
    2. ME correlation
    3. relationship to jaw phase, tongue phase, etc.
2. similar analyses to those in Mike's paper
    1. ptlower cdearly,late,action
        - I think I'd rather just do CD's at each time point from now on
3. coding directions
    1. selectivity explained 
    2. variance explained
4. null/potent analysis
    1. weights for each cell
    2. alignment distributions
    3. activity within null and potent subpsaces
        - which relationships with movement are preserved
        - what dynamics are preserved
5. role of population structure in computatio nthrough dynamics (goes with 4)
    1. in that paper, they argue that non-random connectivity structure is necessary to solve certain decision-making takss
        - is that the case to produce certain movements? or movements during certain parts of the task
        - 

6. null/potent analysis on yujin's data
